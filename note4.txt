Patient is a 32-year-old presenting with foot pain. The patient is an avid runner and says the pain is worst after waking up and after sitting around for a while. Patient said their foot hurt when I was testing his foot strength. Unremarkable history in immediate family and his job and other hobbies don't appear to be contributing factors. My diagnosis is that the patient has tendonitis.
