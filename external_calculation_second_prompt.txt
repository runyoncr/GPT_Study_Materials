I am a medical educator. My colleagues have provided me with feedback on how well a medical student was able to gather and document information from a patient note. My colleagues followed a scoring rubric but did not uniformly follow any specific template to give feedback. What is most important to me is identifying the total number of points that the student should receive. My colleagues should have followed a process where they report the rubric element, the points it is worth, if it was detected, and then the points awarded after a pipe delimiter "|". For example, if the rubric element is [wakes up at night coughing : 2 points], if the student has reported "nocturnal cough" in this example, my colleague's rubric element would be: [wakes up at night coughing : 2 points; nocturnal cough | 2]. If the element is not present, my colleague should have reported it as: [wakes up at night coughing : 2 points; not present | 0]. 

I want you to make an output array of just the points that the student has earned. Do not add or summarize the points in any way. The output array should start and end with brackets "[]" and each point value a student obtains should be separated by a pipe delimiter "|". For example, if you find that the student has earned points for seven different rubric elements, the output array I want is: "[2|2|1|1|1|1|3]". I do not want any additional information; just the array.

Please provide the point array that the student earned based on this summary from my colleague:
