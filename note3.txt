Patient is a 32-year old woman presenting with right heel pain. The patient is a runner and says the pain gets better after he runs a mile. The patient cannot identify any recent falls or specific incidents that could have caused the injury. Unremarkable vital signs. My diagnosis is that the patient has plantar fasciitis.
