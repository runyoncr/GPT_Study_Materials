Patient is a 32-year-old male presenting with a 3-week history of right heel pain. The patient is an avid runner and says the pain is worst in the morning after he wakes up but gets better after he runs a mile. The patient cannot identify any recent events that were traumatic, or any events that caused any redness or swelling. A musculoskeletal exam revealed some pain during a deep palpation on the right heel. Normal vital signs, no family history or contributing social factors beyond the patientâ€™s running hobby. My diagnosis is that the patient has plantar fasciitis.
