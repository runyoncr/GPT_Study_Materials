Patient is late 20â€™s male presenting with a 2-week history of elbow pain. The patient cannot identify any recent events that may have caused a fracture or swelling. Unremarkable vital signs. No fam history of similar injuries, and patient can't think of any hobbies or contributing social factors to injury. My diagnosis is that the patient has an elbow fracture.
