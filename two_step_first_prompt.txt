I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. 
After this message I will paste the rubric rules after 'RULES:'. The rubric is organized by [content : point value]. I will then paste the student note after 'NOTE:'.

I want you to evaluate the patient note to see if the information in the 'content' area is present in the note. If you can find the content (or a lexical variant) in the note, then the student should be credited for the associated point value (the 'point value'). Please keep track of the total number of points that the student earns.
After evaluating the patient note, respond with the numerical value that the student should receive.
Please think through this step by step. I will now provide you with the scoring rules (RULES:) and the student note (NOTE:).
